Part A: Advanced Data Analysis with PySpark or SQL Spark 
1. Using the provided integer.txt file, develop a spark script to count the number of odd and even integers.
  
2. Salary Aggregation with Statistical Analysis
-  Analyze the salary.txt file to compute total salaries per department and investigate trends or discrepancies in salary distributions. 
- Utilize statistical measures (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation) and visualizations of boxplot and histogram.

3. Implement an Optimized MapReduce
-  Utilize the shakespeare.txt file to implement an optimized MapReduce operation that counts specific terms, allowing for case-insensitivity and punctuation removal. 
-  The code is for counting the number of times particular words appear in the document.

4. Word Frequency and Distribution Analysis
- From shakespeare.txt, calculate top 10 and bottom 10 words. Show 10 words with the most count and 10 words with the least count. 

PART B: Advanced Recommender System with Apache Spark
